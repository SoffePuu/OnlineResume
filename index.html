    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a 26-year-old with a background in graphic design. 
      I've dabbled in a bunch of different things – singing, 
      learning programming, and having a blast with photography 
      and videography. I’ve taken on diverse roles in different 
      jobs, navigating through the challenges of high-pressure 
      situations. Living and working in Estonia and Finland brought 
      an international twist to my story, adding adaptability
      and a global vibe to my experiences. Let's connect and chat about all things creative!

          In 2015, I completed a two-month internship at Orange Advertising Agency.

      <li>In November 2017, I began working as a temporary employee at Posti through SOL.

      <li>
        After relocating to Estonia in December 2018, I joined Tallinn Airport in March 2019, 
        initially working part-time for four months in security screening. Subsequently, 
        I transitioned to full-time employment, undergoing training in both airport-specific 
        basics and safety procedures. My responsibilities involved security screening and 
        extensive customer service.

        protection for 10 hours a week across two different stores. This role emphasized independent 
        work and customer assistance.
      </li>
